### Intro

I really like this extension called [Don't track me Google](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dont-track-me-google1/) on Firefox. 

Unfortunately, this extension is not available on Safari, and the author of the extension does not intend to publish it on the AppStore, [Here](https://github.com/Rob--W/dont-track-me-google/issues/46).

Luckily the author made the code open source via MIT license, so I ported one for Safari.

### How to use

- Download the code from this repo

- Build the extension with Xcode

- Don't forget to set Safari to `Allow unsigned extensions` under menu `Develop`.

Tips: I've submitted this extension to Apple, and its status is waiting for review, and I'll provide a link to it here once it's approved.
