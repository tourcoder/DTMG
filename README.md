### Intro

I really like this extension called [Don't track me Google](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dont-track-me-google1/) on Firefox. 

Unfortunately, this extension is not available on Safari, and the maker of the extension does not intend to publish it on the AppStore, [Here](https://github.com/Rob--W/dont-track-me-google/issues/46).

Luckily the maker made the code open source via MIT license, so I ported one for Safari.

### How to use

You can download it from AppStore, [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dtmg-target-links/id1595441111?mt=12](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dtmg-target-links/id1595441111?mt=12)

Or you can build with Xcode

- Download the code from this repo

- Build the extension with Xcode

- Don't forget to set Safari to `Allow Unsigned Extensions` under menu `Develop`.
